What is Caching?
Caching involves storing copies of data in a temporary storage location, or cache, so that subsequent requests for that data can be served more quickly. 
Types of Caches:
1. Memory Cache (RAM Cache): Stores data in the systemâ€™s main memory (RAM).
2. Disk Cache: Stores data on a disk, like an SSD or HDD.
3. CPU Cache: Small, high-speed memory located inside the CPU.
4. Web Cache: Stores web documents (HTML pages, images) to reduce server load, bandwidth usage, and perceived lag.
5. Application Cache: Used by applications to store frequently accessed data to improve performance. 
Purpose of a Caching System:
1. Improves Performance 2. Reduces Latency 3. Minimizes Network Load 4. Enhances Scalability
Cache Replacement Policies:
1. FIFO (First In, First Out). 2. LIFO (Last In, First Out). 3. LRU (Least Recently Used)
4. MRU (Most Recently Used) 5. LFU (Least Frequently Used)
